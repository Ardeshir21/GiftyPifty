      "reviewText": "This is the only shaver I've had that consistently gives my coarse beard a good shave. I have thick whiskers, with the ones on my neck growing flat against it instead of sticking out. This makes foil shavers pretty much ineffective although a Braun series 7 came close but it vibrates severely and takes much longer to shave than with this Norelco. For the record, I first wash my face in the shower and then apply 'Lectric Shave' to stand up my whiskers and lubricate my face for shaving. I've also had success with with a light, non gel foam ('Gillette Foamy') but it's messier and the shave is no better than with the 'Lectric Shave'.When my old version of this shaver died after several years of service, I tried one of the newer 5700 series shavers for several months. Even though they use the same blade sets (SH50/52/previously HQ8), the 4500 gives me a much better shave. It's not just my imagination... I ordered this 4500 and shaved the next day with it for a very noticeable improvement. I'm guessing that the difference must be in the springiness of the blades, the head pivot, and/or the rotation speed.",

      "reviewText": "I had to give this cheap knock off one star so I could write a scathing review. I have been using Norelco razors since 1987. Of maybe 10 or 12 Norelco razors, this is the cheapest, poorest quality, disfunctional Norelco I’ve ever heard about. My seven year old Soectra 8831XL, which I’ve never changed a blade on shaves MUCH better than this piece of garbage out of the box. When trimming my mustache, the blades stopped and got stuck in my mustache. I charged the battery overnight and it’s brand new so the blades should be sharp, yet I had to rip this faulty razor out of my mustache, painful. Once it was out, it started running again. This Norelco has so little power a well groomed man’s blonde hair is too much for the basic functions which it’s designed for. Also, when you turn it on it just sounds cheap. It sounds nothing like any other Norelco I’ve owned. It’s lighter, flimsier, feels cheap, the motor lacks efficient power, sounds cheap, cannot trim or shave as well as decades old Norelcos with dull blades, and the trimmer release has been redesigned and makes it impossible to evenly trim your mustache or beard. My next step is to contact Norelco and verify the serial number, I suspect this is a cheap Chinese knock off being marketed as a product from a reputable company with a reputation and quality, reliability, and customer service. Disappointed",

      "reviewTitle": "Good shaver, good design, but cannot use while plugged in and mine had faded print. Did yours?",
      "reviewText": "As far as functionality goes, it is great. I always go with this classic Norelco design as I think it is the best of all time. I replaced my 4 year old Norelco (that is right, 4 years without needing new blades or any problems-which is why I trust this brand) with this one. Does not feel as well made as my old one, but still very nice. The grip material replaced shell material from previous models (is it for function or is it for corner-cutting? I do not know). Cool digital display. It has increased water proofing than my last model. The first time I used it I didn't have to shave again for longer than usual because it was so close. Also, this model will not let you shave while it is plugged in. Guess what? My last model having a dead battery didn't mean it was bricked because I could plug it in and shave. This one...once the battery no longer will hold a charge (and I bet it is cheaper than previous models and will die faster) it is probably useless. At that point are you going to replace the battery or just buy a new one prematurely? My old one lasted so long...just got dull and gross and it was time to replace it.Lastly: I was very disappointed with the attention to detail Norelco usually has. The print on the back was washed out in places, uneven, and really just cheapened the overall appearance of the product (see the photo: \"ELECTRONICS\" is washed out in the first few letters, and other places have issues). It is very noticeable to the naked eye. If they are not at least making their print look nice on the outside, what is the quality of the stuff on the inside? Little things like this lead me to believe the brand is in decline. Or making products cheaper specifically for Amazon, or some QC/QA middlemen are not being used, to cut corners. The \"no hassle\" packaging is a euphemism for corner cutting and was very chincy for a supposedly high quality product.Do not get me wrong, this thing is effective and is functionally terrific, but it will be used as an experiment to see if it lasts as long as the last one and test to see if the brand is still holding up to their sturdy older products.",

      "reviewTitle": "After 18 months, I still like the Philips Norelco 4500. Highly recommended!",
      "reviewText": "I'm a long-time user of Philips Norelco shavers and have been very happy. The 2 that I had were not holding charges anymore, simply a result of the maximum number of charge cycles on the NiCad batteries. They both worked flawlessly otherwise and are still usable if the charging cords are connected. I read some reviews of the 4500, some negative, but decided to purchase it anyway, choosing to wait to write a review until after I'd had some experience with it. I'm totally satisfied with the unit. I get a shave virtually identical to the older models (the 4500 uses the same blade set!) and it hold a charge and delivers that charge excellently. The one-hour charge time is far superior to the older models that I had and the feel of the shaver is very similar to my older shavers. The only difference might be that this newer model doesn't turn quite as fast. Still, I get a good close shave.I'm on the road about half the year so my 4500 stays in my \"travel bag;\" I still use the older ones at home, with the cord connected. I do NOT immerse the 4500 to clean it. I use the brush and I also have some Norelco shaving head spray lubricant that I use occasionally/randomly/when I feel that the heads could use it.I think it's an excellent value. Terrific battery life, good handling \"feel,\" and a good, close shave.",

      "reviewText": "I'm a wet shave guy but my father is getting on and needed something a bit simpler and less easy to cut himself with so I got this for him and he loves it. He says it gets him as close a shave as he's used to from safety razors and its easy to use. The only thing I would note is the power button is oddly hard to find, even if they just made the icon a different colour than the body it would fix the issue but other than that this is a quality product that I would recommend to anyone looking for an electric shaver and it also has an edger in the back to make sure your sideburns stay sharp.",
